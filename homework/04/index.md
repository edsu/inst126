Download the JSON file *atl.json* from ELMS.  This is a dataset of information
about the Atlantic Building (where our class is held) and its use of resources
such as electricity, natural gas, water and C02 emissions. The data was obtained
from [https://terpfootprints.umd.edu/](https://terpfootprints.umd.edu/).

Write a program that:

* reads the *atl.json* file
* prints out the month with the *most* electricity usage
* prints out the total amount of water used in 2015
