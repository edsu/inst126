<p>There are many useful programs available to you on the command line. Yes, every command you use on the command line is a program that someone somewhere has written. Here are some puzzles to explore a few more useful commands you can use both on Windows with git-bash, and on OS X.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>See if you can find a command that will let you get the contents of a URL. URLs are the strings that start with http in your browser location. Fetch the contents of the homepage for UMD, https://umd.edu</li>
<li>Can you redirect the output to a file named index.html?</li>
<li>Open the index.html file in your browser? What does it look like?</li>
<li>Examine the HTML (for example open it in Code). Can you figure out what software was used to generate the web page?</li>
<li>Can you find a command for searching the text in a file?</li>
<li>See if you can use it to search for a line in index.html that links to the UMD Instagram account.</li>
<li>See if you can send the output of the command directly to the command to search text (hint: use a pipe).</li>
