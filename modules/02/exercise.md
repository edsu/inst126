There are many useful programs available to you on the command line. Yes, every command you use on the command line is a program that someone somewhere has written. Here are some puzzles to explore a few more useful commands you can use both on Windows with git-bash, and on OS X.

1. See if you can find a command that will let you get the contents of a URL. URLs are the strings that start with http in your browser location. Fetch the contents of the homepage for UMD, https://umd.edu
2. Can you redirect the output to a file named index.html?
3. Open the index.html file in your browser? What does it look like?
4. Examine the HTML (for example open it in Code). Can you figure out what software was used to generate the web page?
5. Can you find a command for searching the text in a file?
6. See if you can use it to search for a line in index.html that links to the UMD Instagram account.
7. See if you can send the output of the command directly to the command to search text (hint: use a pipe).
