<p>Now that we’ve spent several weeks learning the basics of programming in Python, and constructing some simple programs to solve small problems, it is time for us to reflect on the strengths and limitations of computational or <em>algorithmic</em> thinking. As you have noticed each of the modules have included readings about how computing impacts our social and political lives. Here the ones we have read so far:</p>
<ul>

<li>Gillespie, T. (2016). <a href="http://culturedigitally.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gillespie-2016-Algorithm-Digital-Keywords-Peters-ed.pdf">Algorithm.</a> In <em>Digital Keywords</em>, edited by Ben Peters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please reflect on the computational processes that are at play in one (or more) of the readings, and the specific <em>social</em> and/or <em>political</em> issue that is at stake. The reflection should describe how a computational process is being deployed in a particular setting, and what the potential positive and negative impacts of that deployment are. Can you describe any possible ways (computational or otherwise) of addressing the concerns raised?</p>
<p>This reflection should be 300-500 words and submitted here in ELMS and will count as 5 points. The points will be assigned as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflection identifies a social or political issue which is being addressed with computing (2 points)</li>
<li>Reflection describes strengths and weaknesses of the use of computation to address the issue (2 points)</li>
<li>Reflection fulfills the formal requirements of the assignment (1 point).</li>
</ul>
