Now that we've spent several weeks learning the basics of programming in Python,
and constructing some simple programs to solve small problems, it is time for us
to reflect on the strengths and limitations of computational or *algorithmic*
thinking. As you have noticed each of the modules have included readings about
how computing impacts our social and political lives. Here the ones we have read
so far:

* Bellowvin, S. (2019). [Yes "algorithms" can be biased. Here’s why.](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/yes-algorithms-can-be-biased-heres-why/) Ars Technica.
* Hernandez, S. (2019). [One Of The Biggest At-Home DNA Testing Companies Is Working With The FBI.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/family-tree-dna-fbi-investigative-genealogy-privacy) BuzzFeed News.
* Donovan, J. (2019). [How Hate Groups’ Secret Sound System Works.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/03/extremists-understand-what-tech-platforms-have-built/585136/) The Atlantic.
* Gillespie, T. (2016). [Algorithm.](http://culturedigitally.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gillespie-2016-Algorithm-Digital-Keywords-Peters-ed.pdf) In *Digital Keywords*, edited by Ben Peters.

Please reflect on the computational processes that are at play in one (or more)
of the readings, and the specific *social* and/or *political* issue that is at
stake. The reflection should describe how a computational process is being
deployed in a particular setting, and what the potential positive and negative
impacts of that deployment are. Can you describe any possible ways
(computational or otherwise) of addressing the concerns raised?

This reflection should be 300-500 words and submitted here in ELMS and will
count as 5 points. The points will be assigned as follows:

* Reflection identifies a social or political issue which is being addressed
  with computing (2 points)
* Reflection describes strengths and weaknesses of the use of computation to
  address the issue (2 points)
* Reflection fulfills the formal requirements of the assignment (1 point).
