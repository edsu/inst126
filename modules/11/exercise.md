[Kaggle] is a community website for data science students and practitioners.
It provides a space to publish [datasets] and host competitions to find
useful patterns in real datasets that can be used to solve practical problems.
The [UMD Data Challenge] is a similar local event, where students from around
campus will work on teams to analyze and use datasets that are relevant to
sustainability here at UMD.

For this exercise search in the Kaggle [datasets] for a CSV dataset that is
relevant for your interests. If you already have a CSV that we haven't used in
class, or that is part of your final project you may use that as well.

1. install [Pandas]
2. start the Python interpreter
3. import pandas
4. create a DataFrame from your CSV file
5. print out the first few rows of the DataFrame with the head *method*
6. print out the first few rows of a Series with the *head* method
7. print the average for one of the numeric rows using the mean() method
8. copy and paste your terminal session into a text file named *exercise11.txt* and 
   upload it here to ELMS
