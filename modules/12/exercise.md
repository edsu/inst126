Download the [Google Play Store Dataset] from Kaggle (CSV) or get it from the
Files area here in ELMS (Files / Modules / Module-12). See if you can use Pandas
to read in the dataset and determine what category of apps have the highest
average rank.

Hint: the DataFrame.groupby() method could be useful!
