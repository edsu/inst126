This week we read this piece by [Salvador Hernandez](https://twitter.com/SalHernandez), who is a reporter at Buzzfeed.

Hernandez, S. (2019). [One Of The Biggest At-Home DNA Testing Companies Is Working With The FBI](). Buzzfeed News. 

The article talks about the effect that identification of the Golden State
Killer had on law enforcement. Family Tree DNA updated their terms of service in
December 2018 to allow you to opt-in or out of having your identity being made
available to law enforcement. Users in Europe are opted-out by default because
of recent privacy laws in the European Union (). But elsewhere users are opted
in by default. Users who do not share their information are unable to look up
other people's information.

The Golden State Killer was identified using a different service called
GEDmatch.  Let's watch this video about the process of creating an account and
uploading your DNA to it. *I want you to pay particular attention to the options
that are available when uploading.*

Take a look at the [GEDmatch Terms of Service](https://www.gedmatch.com/tos.htm).

Now take a couple minutes to jot down some of your thoughts about these questions:

* What conditions did you notice in the upload process?
* How easy is it to understand the Terms of Service?
