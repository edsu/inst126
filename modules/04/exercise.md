Modify the program you created in Module 3 so that it will only calculate the
gross pay if the hourly rate entered is greater than or equal to the minimum
wage ($15/hr).

The program should look like this when you run it:

~~~
Enter hours: 35
Enter rate: 2.75
I'm sorry 2.75 is lower than the minimum wage!
~~~

or on another run:

~~~
Enter hours: 35
Enter rate: 17.50
Pay: $612.50
~~~

Please upload your file in ELMS to the exercise as **{user-id}.py** where
**{user-id}** (including the braces) is replaced by your UMD Directory.
For example: **edsu.py**
