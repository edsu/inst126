<p>This week we read this piece by <a href="https://twitter.com/SalHernandez">Salvador Hernandez</a>, who is a reporter at Buzzfeed.</p>
<p>Hernandez, S. (2019). <a href="">One Of The Biggest At-Home DNA Testing Companies Is Working With The FBI</a>. Buzzfeed News.</p>
<p>The article talks about the effect that identification of the Golden State Killer had on law enforcement. Family Tree DNA updated their terms of service in December 2018 to allow you to opt-in or out of having your identity being made available to law enforcement. Users in Europe are opted-out by default because of recent privacy laws in the European Union (GDPR). But elsewhere users are opted in by default. The opt-in/out is designed to be symmetric, so Users who do not share their information are unable to look up other people’s information.</p>
<p>The Golden State Killer was identified using a different service called GEDmatch. Let’s watch this video about the process of creating an account and uploading your DNA to it.</p>
<p><em>When watching this video please pay particular attention to the options that are available when uploading.</em></p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://www.gedmatch.com/tos.htm">GEDmatch Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>Now take a couple minutes to jot down some of your thoughts about these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What conditions did you notice in the upload process?</li>
<li>How easy is it to understand the Terms of Service?</li>
<li>Do you think the options made available by GEDMatch and Family Tree DNA are effective?</li>
</ul>
