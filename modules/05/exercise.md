Rewrite the pay calculation from the previous exercise by creating a function
called **compute_pay** that will take two arguments: **hours** and **rate** and
will return the pay. Use the function to compute the pay for the hours and rate
that were input and print it out.

Bonus:

For an extra credit point see if you can calculate overtime pay of
[time-and-a-half] when someone has worked over 40 hours. So for example if an
employee worked 50 hours at 15.00 an hour they would be paid $825.00.

40 * 15 + 10 * (15 + 7.50) = 825

Bonus:

See if you can figure out what module to import and what function to use to do the 
following:

1. Print a random number between 1000 and 2000.
2. Print the square root of a number like 22.
3. Draw a circle with radius 50.
