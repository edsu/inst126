Rewrite the pay calculation from the previous exercise by creating a function
called **compute_pay** that will take two arguments: **hours** and **rate** and
will return the pay. Use the function to compute the pay for the hours and rate
that were input and print it out.

As a bonus see if you can calculate overtime pay of time-and-a-half when someone
has worked over 40 hours. So for example if an employee worked 50 hours at 15.00
an hour they would be paid $825.00.

40 * 15 + 10 * (15 + 7.50) = 825
