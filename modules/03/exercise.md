Create a program that will calculate the gross pay based on the number of hours worked and their hourly rate.

The program should look like this when you run it:

~~~
Enter hours: 35
Enter rate: 2.75
Pay: 96.25
~~~

Hint 1: you will need to use the **input** function to read in input.
Hint 2: you will need to convert the inputted strings to floats using the **float** function.

Please upload your file in ELMS to the exercise as **{user-id}.py** where
**{user-id}** (including the braces) is replaced by your UMD Directory e.g. **edsu.py**
