Over the semester I'd like you to keep your eye out for news stories that
involve the political and ethical aspects of computer programming and automation
in general. When we do our reflection writing in a few weeks I will ask you to
write some short pieces on these topics.

This week we read this piece by Steve Bellovin, who is a professor of computer
science at Columbia University:

Bellowvin, S. (2019). [Yes "algorithms" can be biased. Hereâ€™s why.](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/yes-algorithms-can-be-biased-heres-why/) Ars Technica.

For some context to the article here is the segment where Alexandra
Ocasio-Cortez discusses the role the political role that automation plays in our
society in conversation with Ta-Nehisi Coates:

Let's take 5 minutes to discuss:

1. Introduce yourself ðŸ˜€ 
2. Do you agree with Ocasio-Cortez's point about automation?
3. What key points did Bellowvin's make to support her claim?
4. What can we do as technologists and citizens to address bias in technology?
