Over the semester I'd like you to keep your eye out for news stories that
involve the political and ethical aspects of computer programming and automation
in general. When we do our reflection writing over the semester (3 assignments)
I will ask you to write some short essays about these stories.

This week we read this piece by Steve Bellovin, who is a professor of computer
science at Columbia University:

Bellowvin, S. (2019). [Yes "algorithms" can be biased. Hereâ€™s why.](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/yes-algorithms-can-be-biased-heres-why/) Ars Technica.

For some context to the article here is the segment where Rep. Alexandra
Ocasio-Cortez discusses the political role that technology plays in society in
conversation with Ta-Nehisi Coates:

Returning to the Bellovin piece take 2 minutes to write down a few thoughts
about these questions:

1. What evidence does Bellovin use to support AOC's claims about bias in
   algorithms?
2. What are some of his suggestions for addressing the issue of bias?
